                    <h2>Transcendental Meditation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a technique for avoiding distracting thoughts and promoting a state of relaxed awareness. 
                        The late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi derived TM from the ancient Vedic tradition of India. He brought the technique to the U.S. in the 1960s.
            
                        While meditating, the person practicing TM sits in a comfortable position with eyes closed and silently repeats a mantra. 
                        A mantra is a word or sound from the Vedic tradition that is used to focus your concentration.
                        
                        Unlike some forms of meditation, TM technique requires a seven-step course of instruction from a certified teacher.
                        
                        A TM teacher presents general information about the technique and its effects during a 60-minute introductory lecture. 
                        Thats followed by a second 45-minute lecture in which more specific information is given. 
                        People interested in learning the technique then attend a 10- to 15-minute interview and 1 to 2 hours of personal instruction. 
                        Following a brief ceremony, they're each given a mantra, which they're supposed to keep confidential.

                    <h2>Buddhist Meditiation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Buddhist meditation is the practice of mental concentration leading ultimately through a succession of stages to the final goal of spiritual freedom; Nirvana.
                        Four stages, called (in Sanskrit) dhyanas or (in Pali) jhanas, are distinguished in the shift of attention from the outward sensory world: 
                        (1) detachment from the external world and a consciousness of joy and ease, 
                        (2) concentration, with suppression of reasoning and investigation, 
                        (3) the passing away of joy, with the sense of ease remaining, and 
                        (4) the passing away of ease also, bringing about a state of pure self-possession and equanimity.

                        The dhyanas are followed by four further spiritual exercises, the samapattis (“attainments”): 
                        (1) consciousness of infinity of space, 
                        (2) consciousness of the infinity of cognition, 
                        (3) concern with the unreality of things (nihility)
                        (4) consciousness of unreality as the object of thought.

                        Buddhists describe the culminating trancelike state as transient; final nirvana requires the insight of wisdom.

                    <h2>Christian Meditation</h2>
                    <p>  There are a number of ways that Christians can choose to meditate. 
                        However, all Christian meditation must be based on Scripture. 
                        It is important to know that Christians do not meditate to empty the mind, but rather to be unified with the one, true God.
                        Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a Bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.
                        Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion, by focussing on the words of the Christian God; the passages in The Bible.
