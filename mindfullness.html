                    <h2>The Raisin Exercise</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a great introductory exercise for beginners to start practicing mindfulness since it can be attempted by anyone.
                        In this exercise, the facilitator provides participants with a few raisins and asks that they pretend they have never seen a raisin before. 
                        You are then asked  to pay careful attention to:

                        The way the raisin looks;
                        How it feels;
                        How their skin responds to its manipulation;
                        Its smell;
                        Its taste.

                        Focusing on the single object of the raisin is meant to bring the participants mind to the present, to what is right in front of them. 
                        We may be used to raisins, and not used to taking time to actually notice them.

                    <h2>The Body Scan</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another popular exercise for practitioners of mindfulness is called the Body Scan. 
                        It requires very little in the way of props or tools, and it is also easily accessible for most beginners.

                        - step one; lie on your back with palms up and feet apart.
                        - step two; lie very still, only moving with awareness if necessary
                        - step three; begin noticing your breath; rhythm, the experience of inhaling & exhaling, just be aware and focus on it.
                        - step four; move awareness to your body as a whole. How does it feel? how is the texture of clothing against the skin? How is the temperature of the body?
                        - step 5; move awareness to parts of the body that are tingking, sore, or feeling heavy or light.

                    <h2>Mindful Seeing</h2>
                    <p> It is a simple exercise, requiring only a window with some kind of a view. The facilitator guides the group following these steps:
                        Step 1: find a space at a window where there are sights to be seen outside;
                        Step 2: look at everything there is to see. Avoid labeling and categorizing what you see outside the window; instead of thinking “bird” or “stop sign,” try to notice the colors, the patterns, or the textures.
                        Step 3: pay attention to the movement of the grass or leaves in the breeze. Notice the many different shapes present in this small segment of the world you can see. Try to see the world outside the window from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with these sights;
                        Step 4: be observant, but not critical. Be aware, but not fixated;                
                        Step 5: if you become distracted, gently pull your mind away from those thoughts and notice a color or shape again to put you back in the right frame of mind.
