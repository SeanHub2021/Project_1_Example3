                        Mindfulness improves well-being. Increasing your capacity for mindfulness supports many attitudes that contribute to a satisfied life. 
                        Being mindful makes it easier to savor the pleasures in life as they occur, helps you become fully engaged in activities, and creates a greater capacity to deal with adverse events. 
                        By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past, are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, and are better able to form deep connections with others.

                            If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, consider trying meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can help restore your calm and inner peace.
                            Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive. And it doesn't require any special equipment.
                            And you can practice meditation wherever you are â€” whether you're out for a walk, riding the bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting.
